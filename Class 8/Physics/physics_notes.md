## Atmospheric pressure

The pressure applied by the atmosphere on the earth's surface is called atmospheric pressure. 

Or

The pressure exertted on an object by the weight of column of air over it is called atmospheric pressure.

Q ) `Why we are not crushed under this weight of air/atmospheric pressure?`  

--> We are not crushed under the atmospheric pressure because the pressure exerted by the fluids in our body is equal and opposite to the atmospheric pressure acting on our body.

Q ) `How can you demonstrate the effect of atmospheric pressure?`
